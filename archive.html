                  Even in the biggest web apps built on continuous integration servers with automated deploys, CSS is often still being manually tested. Something can easily be missed or regressions can slip in and not be spotted until production.
                <br>
                  As CSS is a declarative language, traditional automated testing techniques either don’t apply or aren’t sensible. This talk aims to give an overview of the techniques available for automated testing such as page render image diffs, reference-browser equality, frozen DOM structure comparisons. It will also cover some of the tools you can use to integrate automated CSS testing into your build pipeline.

                All over the world, charities and social initiatives make sure we have a clean, social and livable today and tomorrow. And sometimes they reach the boundaries of the expertise that their members can provide or that they can afford. Providing such expertise pro bono can be a deciding push forward. The GiveCamp is meant to provide such expertise in a specific field: technology and design. Ten Berlin non-profits will meet at RallyPad for one weekend with 30-50 developers and designers to create market quality solutions.

               And we’re back! Our 30th meetup is drawing ever closer, and with it, our collective mid-life crisis. But fear not, Berlin’s dazzling tech scene is currently spoiling us with amazing conferences (jsconf.eu and reject.js, and there’s Javascript helicopters in there somewhere as well) and attracting smart beings from all around the globe, some of which will be speaking at up.front! This one should be excellent.

                   Is our digital identity different from our analog one? The digital lifestyle is somehow changing our view on ourselves, and we have to cope with these transformations. Is that me inside this machine, or is it just a distorted portrayal? How do I reflect myself when there are different versions of me online? For his bachelor thesis, Christoph wants to explore how philosophy and self-reflection are connected to interaction design.

            <p>And we’re back, and I’m confused, because I’m tzping this on up.front founder @kriesse’s US keyboard, who has returned from San Francisco for a month! In other news, our central theme this week seems to be “high resolution”, with one talk about publishing a magazine, and a second one about resolution-independent front-end work in the wake of even more pixel-density diversity. On a completely different note, RailsGirls will be stopping by to tell us about their awesome project.</p>

                <p>
                  At a time when print is declared dead and traditional media outlets struggle to make a buck, Kai decided to move from designing websites to publishing a print magazine. Offscreen is an old-fashioned periodical on high-quality paper, exploring the life and work of people that create websites and apps. It tells the less obvious human stories of creativity, passion and hard work that hide behind every interface. Kai talks about the whys and hows of his new magazine and offers insight into today’s challenges as an indie publisher.

                <p class="speaker_info">
                  Originally from Germany, Kai now lives in Melbourne, Australia, though, he can be found in various places around the globe when live becomes too repetitive. He’s currently taking a break from his web design career to publish a magazine about digital creators.

                  New ultra-high resolution displays (like the Retina displays touted by Apple in their iOS devices and new MacBook Pro) are changing the way our designs get displayed, requiring us to change some of our development approaches. We’ll look back how the use of space and absolute/relative sizes in design have been translated into digital until now and how it will be done in the feature, presenting some viable solutions to make our sites and apps look good across devices.

              In June we have talks by Martin Spindler, Horia Dragomir and Alex Feyerke. As always, up.front takes place at <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working</a> in Kreuzberg. <strong>NEW: For the first time we’ll use co.up’s brand new rooms in the third floor.

                <p>
                  Computers are getting ever cheaper, smaller and more energy efficient. This leads to an ever-increasing amount of digital hybrids — everyday objects equipped with digital capabilities. But this emerging new class of “computers”, often dubbed the Internet of Things, demands new interfaces that accommodate those new capabilities. What does it mean to design for the Internet of Things, then?

                <p>
                  Computers are tools that help people accomplish tasks by making the process easier, faster, cheaper, less error-prone, or just more fun.
                  But what tasks? And by what process? What parts of the process can the computer make better? How can users interact with the computer to make it do its part of the process? Only lastly can we ask: what must be presented to the user and how?

                <p class="speaker_info">
                  Tiffany is a Canadian living in Berlin doing front-end development and interaction design at SoundCloud.

                <h4><span>Kelly Sutton, LayerVault:</span> From MVP to business in 9 months</h4>

                <p>LayerVault started as a Quora thread. "What are the tools or methods to manage design files?" Allan Grinshtein sent Kelly Sutton (me) an IM, "Man it sucks to be a designer. Think you could build something?" Sutton had a prototype ready to show off the next Monday. Nine months later, they are used by the best designers worldwide.</p>

                <p>While the days of LayerVault are still extremely early, there are quite a few lessons learned. Is "just ship it" always the best advice? What’s the best way to deal with copycats? How can I work as fast as humanly possible?</p>

                <p class="speaker_info">Kelly Sutton is a software developer from New York City. He’s currently traveling the world. In the past, he’s made HackCollege and the Cult of Less and worked for blip.tv and Gilt Groupe.</p>

                  We will walk you through the rationale of some of our design decisions
                  (both the intentional and the incidental ones), we will talk about
                  climbing to top of the travel category in the German App Store in just
                  48 hours, and we will confuse correlation with causation a lot.

                      <p>
                        Though we’ve barely even had time to get used to Webfonts, the next big challenge is already looming on the horizon for font users and manufacturers: fonts for apps and mobile devices. As with Webfonts, which have already become practically indispensable, there are a myriad of special considerations involved, including technical matters and, more importantly, legal issues. This presentation aims to sensitize both developers and graphic designers to this dicey topic and to introduce possibilities for secure embedding of mobile fonts.

The gratuated engineer in print and media technology studied at Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin and used to work as a media designer.

                        When starting a consulting/agency business, there are a few things to do: Find a beautiful office, hire kick-ass developers and brilliant designers, and &hellip; get your own web site online.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The latter seems easy at first but can be the greatest challenge of all as we noticed when founding LAUNCH/CO. In this talk we’ll talk about the ever-lasting process of launching our own website and what we’ve learned.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As mid-life crisis hit Javi hard on the head and fellow designers &amp; friends
                        kept on asking him the same questions about improving their technique or getting better at designing, He started wondering: “What did I learn those years that could be helpful for others?
                        What kind of advice would I give myself as a designer if I was travelling 10 years back in time?”

                        Although we spend lots of time and money on designing our interfaces, we don’t always pay the same kind of attention to sounds. Marco’s talk is about finding out when to use sound and what sounds are good to use in your interface.

                      <p>
                        Agile development has long become the standard way of creating web applications. Still, many teams struggle to integrate interface design and other visual disciplines into their workflow. For the past five months, we have been one of them. As we developed a web application from ground up, we had to figure out how to keep developers and designers in sync – without slowing down the project. In this talk we’d like to share our learnings on how to set up and run a successful team with a maximum of agility – under real-world conditions. Hop the truck and keep your wrenches ready.

                      <p>
                        Every company thinks about how to present their app. But is it more important to present the company’s style or to make an app that looks good on its platform? Is it more important to have a light blue status bar or to have one that doesn’t break your own guidelines. That’s what Max Fellmuth wants to discuss with you. Max spends his whole day doing UI design (and school) and will give some insights to good and also bad branding in apps.

              <h4><span>Stephen Coles:</span> Cure for the Common Font — A Web Designer’s Introduction to Typeface Selection</h4>
              <p>
                Now that web designers suddenly face the challenge (and delight) of choosing fonts from an ever-growing selection, it’s a good time to recommend some basic principles for making wise type choices.

              <h4><span>Gearóid O’Rourke:</span> Taking print design online</h4>
              <p>
              Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is a discipline in it’s adolescence — the classic teenager; all existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at “cool”. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and pitfalls of “fuddy-duddy” print design, but has forgotten that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br />
              Gearóid spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the youngest designer at Ireland’s oldest newspaper he learned print design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to the web designer who is willing to listen. Gearóid will explore these insights under 3 headings – process, philosophy and practicalities.
              </p>
              <p class="speaker_info">
              Gearóid is a 24 year-old Irish guy who runs a one-man design studio in London. He has worked as an editorial designer with the News of the World, The Irish Times and the Sun. He welcomes our new online overlords in “the cloud”.

              <p>
                For some people it is a trouble-maker in German orthography, for some a shortcoming in typography but to Nadine it is the most beautiful letter – The German Eszett.
                Throughout history no other character has had to put up with so much and almost no other letter has been the subject of so much discussion. Her surname contains this rare character. That’s the reason why, in her thesis, she decided to put some thought into what could be done to place it in a better light. That was the basis of the project »Eine scharfe Type« – A sharp character.

FontFont is the world’s largest library of original contemporary typefaces. Together with Ivo Gabrowitsch and Jörg Haubrichs, head of marketing and developer at FontFont, the team at Edenspiekermann redesigned the website from scratch in a collaborative and agile way. Almost no Photoshop pixels were harmed in the making of the site. Instead, most of the design took place in the browser using tools such as Haml and Sass.

              <p>Whenever Tools of choice are discussed its easy to start off a heated debate. Its 2011 and Websites are still started in Photoshop. We laughed at the print people using InDesign, now it ships with pixel measures and we dream about the automatic recovery when Fireworks beachball crashed again. And of course beyond Adobe, who needs a flat demo of an interactive Design anyways, after all rapid prototyping has been around a while.<br />>His talk will showcase different case of Tool combinations, how they fit in a real world workflow and the own choice always seems superior to everyone elses. A heated debate will follow.</p>

            On December 14th we are going to gather for a special Christmas edition of our meet-up. Let’s enjoy some mulled wine, munch cookies and hear a lightning talk or two.
            If you want to share a cool new tool, technology or case that fits into the web design frontend category in a lightning talk (~5min), you are very welcome to share it with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would also like to plan the next meet-ups with you! Which topics do you want to discuss or would you like to be discussed? Do you think theme nights like the last one make sense or would you rather go for mixed evenings, etc.
            This is also a great chance to give us feedback about past events.
          </p>

          <p>PS: Baked some tasty cookies? Bring ’em! :-)</p>

              <p>Open data is everywhere. Institutions and companies all around us start to open up their databases, provide APIs and give the Web community the power to build applications on top. But what if we could combine all that open data to build apps no only of one open data silo, but multiple, by cross-linking all that data data? Wouldn’t that be much more powerful?<br />This talk gives an intro to how this little idea - four years ago - became the Linking Open Data project, with hundreds of connected data sources.</p>

              <p>Handheld electronics, location devices, telecommunications networks, and a wide assortment of tags and sensors are constantly producing a rich stream of data reflecting various aspects of urban life. Managed well, “big data” can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide new insights into scions and give governments to account. Meanwhile, some of the world’s foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers are trying to understand this data to harness it for answers to our biggest problems.<br />In this talk, Edial Dekker will address the benefits of seeing cities as a platform that is able to reinvent itself. A main theme in this talk will be the role of data visualizations and a project called City Crawlers Berlin.</p>

              <p>
              Wolfram Kriesing picks up the current hype around apps and HTML5. Is the app store only a temporary thing? Most apps can be built using web technologies. More and more APIs are coming to the browser. Will a native app still be around in the future, do we need them or just the company that gets the 30% share off of every app? He will show you what web technologies can do where you maybe thought only an app could go, and will also show an outlook of where we are heading.

              <h4><span>Alex Feyerke:</span> On the future of Flash</h4>
              <p>In the light of the current discussion about Flash vs. HTML5 and Canvas, Alex Feyerke is searching for Flash’s place in the web, exploring where it went wrong, where it got better, and where it’s surprisingly awesome. Followed, hopefully, by a fruitful debate on Flash’s relevance and future (one that goes beyond “Steve Jobs said it’s terrible and has to die”).</p>
